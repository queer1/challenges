Dump an instruction trace with tracert from
5908bb880a685bd7cdb226c50d9186db5776ccda and execute the following command.

$ grep 'ptr \[' log.txt |grep '*4'|grep lea|grep -v j|cut -d+ -f2|cut -d] -f1

We will now have the addresses of all the jump tables which only set a
hardcoded imm8 to a hardcoded address. Using the table dumper in baboon.cpp
from 69b1bc2f32628fc791cc27dcc7e08a8df1d51aec we can then dump the tables.

The bash script dump.sh will dump all tables, one at a time. Dump these tables
to a python file, so we can import them later.


Besides jump tables, we also have to dump various simple lookup tables. We
find them by running the following command against one of the newer logs.

$ egrep '(lea|mov)' jemoeder1a|grep '\['|py logparser.py a

From there on, we dump them using dump.sh with our dumpmem.py script, which
reads the bytes directly from the binary.
